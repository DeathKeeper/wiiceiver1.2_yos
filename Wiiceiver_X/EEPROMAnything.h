 * WARNING WARNING WARNING: attaching motors to a skateboard is 
 * a terribly dangerous thing to do.  This software is totally
 * for amusement and/or educational purposes.  Don't obtain or
 * make a wiiceiver (see below for instructions and parts), 
 * don't attach it to a skateboard, and CERTAINLY don't use it
 * to zip around with just a tiny, ergonomic nunchuck instead
 * of a bulky R/C controller.
 *
 * This software is made freely available.  If you wish to 
 * sell it, don't.  If you wish to modify it, DO! (and please
 * let me know).  Much of the code is derived from others out
 * there, I've made attributuions where appropriate.
