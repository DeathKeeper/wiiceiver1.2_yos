"archives" of Wiiceivers past

Wiiceiver_84 was based on the ATtiny84, a 14-pin Arduino-compatible
microcontroller.  It's significantly smaller than the ATmega328,
but doesn't have hardware support for I2C or PWM.  I successfully
emulated these in software (with significant help from available
libraries) but was having trouble with the Nyko Kama, and it can't 
present both Serial output as well as I2C and PWM -- hard to debug.
SN01 == Serial Number 1, it was soldered on hardware.  Works with 
a wired chuck, but see above re: debugging the Nyko.

Wiiceiver_85 was the same, but for ATtiny85: 8 pins, but otherwise
similar to the '84.
